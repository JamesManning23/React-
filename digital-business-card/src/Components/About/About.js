        <h3>I am a software development bootcamp student, currently learning front-end and back-end skills such as HTML5, CSS3, vanilla Javascript, SQL, and Python. I have a passion for coding and creating innovative solutions for real-world problems. I also have over four years of experience as a bar supervisor in the hospitality industry, where I managed teams, handled stock, and ensured customer satisfaction.

        In my previous roles as a bar supervisor, I worked with different suppliers, POS systems, and staff training programs. I also co-coordinated health and safety training, participated in regular meetings to boost morale and improve knowledge of mixology. I contributed to the success of the venues by increasing sales, resolving disputes, and maintaining quality standards. I value teamwork, communication, and continuous learning, and I am eager to apply my skills and experience to the software development field. I believe I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team and help create engaging and user-friendly products.</h3>
